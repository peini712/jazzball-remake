I remade a jazz ball game!
You (player) are the blue ball moving around the green frame.
The enemy is the red bouncing ball. Try to catch it by drawing pink lines. 
WASD to draw to each direction. Press L to return to game is one round is over.
You only have 3 lives. If you hit the red ball while you drawing lines, lives will be deducted! 
Lives remaining are shown on the top left corner of screen.
A red screen is losing and a blue screen is winning!
Good Luck!
